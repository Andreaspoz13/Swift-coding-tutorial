# Swift-coding-tutorial
A little project where I try to make a little tutorial explaining everything about Swift coding on a single file

Here is a little description about it. You can find release info on th releases readme files
THANKS

The file is constantly getting updated when I have free time and it is very descriptive.
Go check out CodeWithChris or something IF you still don't understand!
